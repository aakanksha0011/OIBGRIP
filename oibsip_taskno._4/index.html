                        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
                        He served as the 11th President
                        of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
                        Kalam earned a degree in
                        aeronautical engineering from the
                        Madras Institute of Technology and in
                        1958 joined the Defence Research and
                        Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                        In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                        Space Research Organisation, where he
                        was project director of the SLV-III, the
                        first satellite launch vehicle that was
                        both designed and produced in India.
                        <br><br> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                        Kalam planned the program that produced
                        a number of successful missiles, which
                        helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                        “Missile Man.”</strong>
                        <br><br> Among those successes
                        was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                        ballistic missile, which incorporated
                        aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                        in 1989.
                        <br><br> He also played a
                        pivotal organisational, technical,
                        and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                        the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                        <br><br> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                        was scientific adviser to the defense
                        minister, and he later served as principal
                        scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                        government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                        <br><br> His prominent role in
                        the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                        solidified India as a nuclear power and
                        established Kalam as a national hero,
                        although the tests caused great concern
                        in the international community.
                        <br><br> In 1998 Kalam put
                        forward a countrywide plan called
                        Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                        as a road map for transforming India from
                        a less-developed to a developed society
                        in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                        other measures, increasing agricultural
                        productivity, emphasizing technology as
                        a vehicle for economic growth, and
                        widening access to health care and
                        education.
